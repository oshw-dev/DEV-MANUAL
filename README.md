## General info
Purpose of the OSHW project is to build opensource electronics.

Build good hardware require to iterate the learn, try and fail pattern. An help would have some good building block to ensure that even big tasks can be completed.

OSHW is the new home of this building blocks.

We want do it following some rules and methods.

The rules:
* The development process should be clear, tracked, public
* Follow state-of-the-art engineering specs
* Products should be human friendly, eco-friendly, repairable and designed to last
* Every module, project or software must be released with an OSHW compliant license
* Develop only with open source software, using the most open and widely accepted file formats

## The workflow

* Every *project* or a *module* or *whatever* should start with a **request.md**
* If Dev team accept the request should produce a detailed **specs.md** and (at least) basic **readme.md**
* Github project workflow manages the variuos tasks
* Tasks should take in account for: supply chain optimization (OPL), estimate cost and time, reveal flaws, solve design issue, get feedbacks
* OSHW Lab will do manufacture/assembly and the required hardware test then send feedbacks to the Dev team
* **readme.md** should be filled with required details
* OSHW Lab will eventually do report hardware test in **/test** directory
